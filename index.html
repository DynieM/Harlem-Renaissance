		<h2>BRIEF HISTORY & INFLUENCE</h2>
		<p>
			The <strong> New Negro Movement </strong> , otherwise known as the
			<strong> "Harlem Renaissance," </strong> is an African-American cultural
			movement that rose in the 1920 to mid-1930s in New York City. Many see it
			as the rebirth of African-American art, where an explosion of cultural
			pieces like music and literature occured. The movement was influenced by
			the formation of African-American communities caused by the Great
			Migration, a large movement of African-Americans resettling from the South
			of the U.S. to the Northern regions (aka Harlem) due to restrictive Jim
			Crow laws. Soon enough northern Manhattan Harlem transitioned from what
			was meant to be a high-class white neighborhood, to an area vibrant with
			intellectual and cultural revival centered in black identity and freedom
			of expression.

						One of the Renaissance's most famous artists goes by the name of
						<strong> Archibald John Motley Jr. </strong> He was also known as
						one of the African-American graduates of the School of the Art
						Institute of Chicago. Archibald was considered a jazz modernist and
						became prominent during the beginning of the Harlem Renaissance. His
						work consisted of vivid storytelling narratives with spatial
						distortion and striking hues that set the scene for all people of
						color and melanin shades/hues.

						A personal favorite, <strong> Zora Neale Hurson </strong> was a
						world-renowned writer as well as anthropologist. Her writing
						perfectly encapsulated African-American life in the South through
						short stories, novels, and plays. She influenced many writers, and
						her work in anthropology took a look at black folklore. Titles of a
						couple of her well-known novels are <i> "Mules and Men" </i> and
						<i> "Their Eyes were Watching God." </i> Hurston also created a
						school of dramatic arts at Bethune-Cookman College and worked as a
						drama teacher at North Carolina College for Negroes at Durham.
						Throughout her life she contributed to the growth of
						African-American literature and is ranked as one of the best writers
						of the 20th century.

						Commonly known as one of the founding fathers of jazz,
						<strong> Louis Armstrong </strong> was a revolutionary jazz musician
						during the Harlem Renaissance. He joined the Fletcher Henderson
						Orchestra in 1924 after moving to New York City and played soulful
						solos so resounding it led to musicians experimenting with sound and
						impacting the way jazz was created. Armstrong became recognized as
						an influential jazz musician and would later on create hits like
						<i> "What A Wonderful World" </i> and
						<i>"Hello Dolly."</i>

		<div id="legacy">
			<p>
				The Harlem Renaissance was a cultural awakening for all
				African-Americans. In it's wake, it instilled self-determination and
				pride in all Black people around that time period. Along with new
				self-consciousness and a new commitment for political activism. The
				movement itself even provided a foundation for the Civil Rights Movement
				of the 1950s & 1960s. Best of all, culture and art were used to improve
				the lives of African-Americans.
